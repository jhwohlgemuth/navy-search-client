↵No officers promoted in this category.
↵
↵2.  If a selected officer does not decline his or her promotion in writing
↵prior to his or her projected date of rank (noted above in paragraph 1), that
↵officer is considered to have accepted the promotion on the date indicated.
↵An officer who chooses to decline his or her promotion must submit the
↵declination in writing to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806), prior to the effective
↵date indicated above.  Limited duty officers declining appointment to
↵lieutenant will be reverted to enlisted status within 90 days of projected
↵promotion date.
↵
↵3.  The commanding officer (CO), the Secretary of the Navy or his designee,
↵have the authority to delay projected appointments.  Upon the exercise of a
↵delay, the officer shall be notified in writing before the effective date of
↵the appointment, and not be tendered the appointment.  The delay authority
↵will immediately forward the recommendation to delay with supporting
↵documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).
↵
↵4.  COs are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the officers they are
↵promoting are mentally, physically, morally and professionally qualified.
↵Per reference (a), officers are ineligible for promotion if they have failed
↵the most recent Physical Fitness Assessment.  COs shall verify the promoting
↵officer's information in the Physical Readiness Information Management System
↵to ensure compliance with reference (a) as modified by reference (e) and
↵delay the officers promotion in accordance with paragraph 3 if required.
↵
↵5.  Prepare a Delivery of Temporary/Permanent Appointment (NAVPERS form
↵1421/7) (Rev 10-13).  Use this NAVADMIN as reference (a).  Use section 624 of
↵title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b), for permanent lieutenants and above.
↵Use section 578 of title 10, U.S.C. as reference (b), for chief warrant
↵officers.  Use sections 624 and 5589 of title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b),
↵for limited duty officer promotion to lieutenant.  Limited duty officer
↵appointment to lieutenant is a permanent appointment; acceptance of the
↵appointment is acceptance of permanent appointment as a limited duty officer.
↵Mail the completed form to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).
↵
↵6.  Officers should review reference (b), for minimum time-in-grade
↵requirements for purposes of voluntary retirement.  Full time support
↵officers and those officers temporarily on active-duty anticipating release
↵from active-duty under reference (c), may accept promotion without incurring
↵any additional active-duty obligation.
↵
↵7.  New photographs are required for all officers within three months after
↵acceptance of promotion.  See reference (d), for specific requirements.
